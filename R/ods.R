#' Specify a given design for Outcome Dependent Sampling (ODS)
#'
#' Specify the design of an outcome dependent sampling routine.
#'
#' @param formula (or an object that can be
#'   coerced to that class): a symbolic description of the sampling
#'   model.
#' @param data `data.frame`; an optional data frame, list or environment (or
#'   object coercible by as.data.frame to a data frame) containing the variables
#'   in the model. If not found in data, the variables are taken from
#'   environment(formula), typically the environment from which acml is called.
#' @param p_sample `numeric(n)`; A numeric vector with sampling probabilities
#'   for each region specified by cutpoints.
#' @param cutpoints a specification of the cutpoints for sampling.
#' @param method `character(1)`; A string that specifies 'slope', 'intercept', 'bivariate'
#' @param subset an optional vector specifying a subset of observations to be
#'   used in the fitting process. (See additional details about how this
#'   argument interacts with data-dependent bases in the ‘Details’ section of
#'   the model.frame documentation.)
#' @param weights	an optional vector of weights to be used in the fitting
#'   process. Should be NULL or a numeric vector. If non-NULL, weighted least
#'   squares is used with weights weights (that is, minimizing sum(w*e^2));
#'   otherwise ordinary least squares is used. See also ‘Details’,
#' @param na.action a function which indicates what should happen when the data
#'   contain NAs. The default is set by the na.action setting of options, and is
#'   na.fail if that is unset. The ‘factory-fresh’ default is na.omit. Another
#'   possible value is NULL, no action. Value na.exclude can be useful.
#' @param ... additional arguments.
