#' Outcome Dependent Sampling (ODS) correction methods
#'
#' When outcome covariates are available one can perform biased
#' sampling to maximize information returned, or outcome dependent sampling
#' (ODS). This is especially helpful
#' to minimize exposure or an expensive test. The statistical analysis
#' requires correction and this package has routines to assist in this
#' process via multiple methods.
